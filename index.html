    I'm 27 ears old, student for Computer Science, live in Haifa.
    <br><br> 
    A short story about how I started studying at the Faculty of Computer Science. After the army, I went to study photography and cinema. In the second year of study, I became bored, my brain got bored. So I took online courses on Java and OOP principles. After a while, I showed no interest in college at all and focused on assignments and articles from the course. At the beginning of year 3, I decided to leave college and go to study computer science for a degree.
